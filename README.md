### Creating your own copy of this repository

Clone this repo or download the ZIP to your local machine.

If you choose to clone, use the following command in your terminal:

After cloning, update the [remote repository URL](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories#changing-a-remote-repositorys-url) to host the project on your personal GitHub account.

**Note:** It's best to avoid forking this repository directly as it may link your final solution to this repo.

Alternatively, you can import this repository directly to your GitHub account using [GitHub's import tool](https://github.com/new/import). In the **Your old repositoryâ€™s clone URL** field, enter: https://github.com/klmoot/fe-tech-test.git, set the repo details, then hit begin import.
